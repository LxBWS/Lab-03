# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a template contract for an ERC20 and a test file for it. Once the contract is completed and correct, all tests should pass.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```
